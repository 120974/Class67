Prologue 
Once upon a time… no, no, no… that isn’t right...this isn’t once upon a time!
This is the present day! 
Anyway, there were three babies. 
One was called Ug Li. 
The second was called PuPu, as in P-U P-U. 
The third one was called Timmy Timmy, but everybody calls him Tim Tim. 
They were about to embark on a mission to find the Cookie Jar,
a valuable treasure that the babies had only seen in parental newsletters. 
They were armed with Nerf guns, baby powder for their butts, plastic blocks,
and the best in urine-absorbing diapers! 
A war is on the one and only King Baby the Turd, who with his tyranny has locked them in Crib Prison.
First the babies have to plan their escape…
