Prologue 
Once upon a time… no, no, no… that isn’t right...this isn’t once upon a time!
This is the present day! 
Anyway, there were three babies. 
One was called Ug Li. 
The second was called PuPu, as in P-U P-U. 
The third one was called Timmy Timmy, but everybody calls him Tim Tim. 
They were about to embark on a mission to find the Cookie Jar,
a valuable treasure that the babies had only seen in parental newsletters. 
They were armed with Nerf guns, baby powder for their butts, plastic blocks,
and the best in urine-absorbing diapers! 
A war is on the one and only King Baby the Turd, who with his tyranny has locked them in Crib Prison.
First the babies have to plan their escape…

The Escape
Before the babies could do anything, they needed to get out of the Crib Prison.
 “I have an idea!” Tim Tim said. 
“An idea is classified as a noun.”said Ug Li.
“Shut up, Ug.”
“GOTEEM!!! You should have figured it out by now, Tim Tim,” screamed PuPu. Peeped. 
“Yes! I know! We could use our plastic building blocks to build a staircase to run away  from the Crib Prison!”
Suddenly, the three babies were building a staircase at the speed of light (that’s just unreal.)But, just when Ug was about to climb up, Timmy pushed him over the staircase.
“@&/# you, Ug.”
“@&/# you too, Tim Tim!”
PuPu and Tim Tim crawled away from the swearing Ug.
